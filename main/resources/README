1. Put all the files in the same folder for this to work.
2. It's okay to start whichever page first but index.html is the main page.
3. For now, only "add student" button works to add a dummy student
   And whenever you open student.html there is an onload function (that works
   as soon as the page loads) to fill the student array automatically.
4. In order for the functions and everything to work we need to configure our server
   so it accepts communication with our "unknown" client.
   To do so - in our controller class in the server applet we add the
   @CrossOrigin(origins = "<our computer's url>") statement on top of our class name,
   right above @RestController.
   In the case we don't know our computer's url or we want to work offline we can enter
   a wildcard - *.
   @CrossOrigin(origins = "*") <- like this.
   Remember not to push or commit the wildcard because it is a security vulnerability.
5. After adding the clause the requests should work so you can add the dummy value by
   clicking the "add student" button on the office.html page and then see it
   in the list on student.html page.
